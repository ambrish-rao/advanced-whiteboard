📌 Feature Development Roadmap (Step by Step)
Phase 1: Core Whiteboard

        Drawing (pen, eraser, colors, stroke size)
        Shapes (rectangle, circle, line, arrows)
        Text Tool (add/edit text, font size, color, style)
        Sticky Notes (drag & drop, color options)
        Image Upload (insert, resize, rotate, drag)

Phase 2: Multi-Page & Export

        Multi-page whiteboard (like slides) with navigation
        Export as PNG (single page)
        Export as PDF (all pages, slide-by-slide)

Phase 3: Collaboration

        Real-time sync with Socket.IO
        Multi-user drawing on same board
        Live chat sidebar (Socket.IO + MongoDB for storing chats)
        Presence indicators (show who is online)

Phase 4: Advanced Features

         History & Version Control (Undo/Redo + Timeline Playback)  
         Zoom & Pan tool (like Figma/Miro)  
         AI Shape Detection (convert rough shapes to perfect ones)  
         Voice Notes (record → save → attach to board)

Phase 5: Authentication & User Profiles

        Signup/Login (JWT Auth + Bcrypt password hashing)
        Save boards to user account
        My Boards dashboard (list, open, delete)
        Share boards (unique link for collaboration)
